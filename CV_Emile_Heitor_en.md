##### _Technical Manager - May 2006 to November 2009_

* OpenSource and technical expertise: **under my leadership**, the Operations
  Services support have brought a technical expertise to the Professional
  Services. Due to my involvement in the OpenSource community, my expertise
  has often been requested regarding Free Software integration into
  NetCentrex's Solutions.
* Platform deployment design: NetCentrex VoIP platform is composed of many
  **SIP registrars, call routing engines, load balancers, customer care
  XMLRPC/HTTP(s)  services, distributed databases and LDAP servers**. These
  complex platforms are deployed and monitored using an infrastructure I
  designed. Around **800 servers** were installed using our mechanism, thus
  considerably reducing delivery time to customers like **Orange France Telecom,
  Tiscali Italy or AOL Germany**.
